# Screen Recorder with Remotion Integration

A screen recording and editing application with Remotion video export capabilities.

## Features

- Screen recording with cursor tracking
- Video editing with timeline
- Zoom and text effects
- Background customization
- Two export options:
  - Standard canvas-based export
  - High-quality Remotion export (experimental)

## Remotion Integration

This project includes integration with [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/), a framework for creating videos programmatically using React.

### How It Works

1. The app records your screen and captures mouse movements
2. You can add zoom effects and text overlays to the recording
3. When exporting, you can choose between:
   - Standard export (using Canvas API)
   - Remotion export (for higher quality)

### Current Implementation

The Remotion integration is currently implemented as a client-side demo. For a full implementation, a Node.js backend would be required to utilize Remotion's server-side rendering capabilities.

### Usage

1. Record your screen
2. Edit your video with effects
3. Click the "Remotion Export" button
4. Preview how your video will look in Remotion
5. Click "Start Export" to generate the video

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Future Plans

- Server-side Remotion rendering for higher quality exports
- More export options and effects
- Audio support
- Additional editing features
