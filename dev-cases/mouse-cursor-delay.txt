Mouse Cursor Delay Fix
=====================

Problem
-------
Mouse cursor overlay appearing to trail behind actual cursor position during video playback.

Root Cause
----------
Original approach used a backward-looking time window, causing inherent delay:

const timeWindow = 1/30;
currentPositions = mousePositions.filter(pos => 
  pos.timestamp >= currentVideoTime - timeWindow && 
  pos.timestamp <= currentVideoTime
);

Attempted Solutions
------------------
1. Linear Interpolation between prev/next positions
   Result: Reduced delay but still noticeable

2. Finding closest position to current time
   Result: Better but still some delay

Final Solution
-------------
Look ahead approach - always show future position:

const lookAheadTime = currentTime + 1/30;
const aheadPosition = mousePositions.find(pos => pos.timestamp >= lookAheadTime);
const position = aheadPosition || mousePositions[mousePositions.length - 1];

Why It Works
-----------
- Instead of looking at past positions, we look ahead by 1 frame
- Compensates for natural playback delay
- Uses future position to make cursor appear more responsive
- Falls back to last position if at end of recording
