Mouse Cursor Smoothing
=====================

Problem
-------
Mouse cursor movement appears jittery with small variations and micro-movements.

Solution
--------
Implemented weighted average smoothing:
- Takes a window of positions (5 frames) around current time
- Applies weighted averaging where positions closer to current time have more weight
- Uses formula: weight = 1 / (timeDiff + 0.1)

Implementation
-------------
const windowSize = 5;  // 5 frames window
relevantPositions = mousePositions.filter(pos => 
  pos.timestamp >= currentTime - (windowSize/30) && 
  pos.timestamp <= currentTime + (windowSize/30)
);

// Weighted average calculation
positions.forEach(pos => {
  const timeDiff = Math.abs(pos.timestamp - currentTime);
  const weight = 1 / (timeDiff + 0.1);
  smoothX += pos.x * weight;
  smoothY += pos.y * weight;
});

Why It Works
-----------
- Reduces jitter by averaging multiple positions
- Maintains responsiveness by weighting recent positions more heavily
- Window size of 5 frames provides good balance between smoothness and latency
