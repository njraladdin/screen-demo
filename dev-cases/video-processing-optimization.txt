Video Processing Optimization
===========================

Problem
-------
Initial implementation used chunk-by-chunk sequential transfer of video data from Rust to frontend:
- Each chunk required separate IPC call
- Base64 encoding/decoding overhead for each chunk
- Sequential processing created bottleneck
- ~4-5 seconds delay for 60MB video
- Memory pressure from accumulating all chunks in memory

Root Cause
----------
Original approach had multiple inefficiencies:
1. File was opened/closed for each chunk
2. Sequential chunk processing
3. Multiple IPC calls
4. Unnecessary data transformations
5. Memory mapping conflicts between recordings

Initial Solution Attempt
-----------------------
Tried parallel chunk loading with memory mapping:

const chunks: (Uint8Array | null)[] = new Array(numChunks).fill(null);
const chunkPromises = Array.from({ length: numChunks }, async (_, index) => {
    const base64Chunk = await invoke<string>("get_video_chunk", { chunkIndex: index });
    chunks[index] = Uint8Array.from(atob(base64Chunk), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
});
await Promise.all(chunkPromises);

Result: Still inefficient due to:
- Multiple IPC calls still required
- Base64 encoding/decoding overhead remained
- Memory mapping conflicts between recordings
- Memory pressure from holding all chunks

Final Solution
-------------
Implemented local HTTP server with native video streaming:

1. Start local HTTP server in Rust when recording stops
2. Stream video directly to browser using proper HTTP range requests
3. Handle CORS and content-type headers correctly
4. Clean up resources between recordings
5. Use browser's native video streaming capabilities

Implementation Details:
- Server starts on dynamic port (8000-9000)
- Proper handling of HTTP range requests for seeking
- Content-Type: video/mp4 header
- CORS headers for localhost access
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Single file handle for entire playback
- Zero-copy file access where possible

Code Structure:
- start_video_server(): Starts HTTP server, returns port
- cleanup_resources(): Ensures proper cleanup between recordings
- Handle OPTIONS requests for CORS
- Handle GET requests with range support
- Proper error handling and resource management

Why It Works
-----------
1. Leverages browser's native video streaming:
   - Efficient buffering
   - Native seeking support
   - Memory management handled by browser

2. Eliminates multiple overheads:
   - No base64 encoding/decoding
   - No chunk management
   - No memory accumulation
   - No multiple IPC calls

3. Better resource management:
   - Single file handle
   - Automatic cleanup
   - No memory mapping conflicts
   - Proper CORS handling

Performance Improvement
---------------------
Before:
- 4-5 seconds delay for 60MB video
- High memory usage
- Stuttering during playback
- Resource conflicts between recordings

After:
- Almost immediate playback
- Minimal memory overhead
- Smooth seeking
- No resource conflicts
- Native video controls work properly

Files Changed
------------
src-tauri/src/lib.rs:
- Added HTTP server implementation
- Added resource cleanup
- Modified video handling logic

src/App.tsx:
- Removed chunk handling code
- Updated to use video URL directly
- Simplified video loading logic

Lessons Learned
--------------
1. Native browser capabilities often outperform custom implementations
2. Reducing data transformations is crucial for performance
3. Proper resource cleanup is essential for reliability
4. HTTP streaming is more efficient than manual chunk transfer
5. Browser's video implementation handles many edge cases automatically
