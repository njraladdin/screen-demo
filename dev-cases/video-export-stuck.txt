Video Export Getting Stuck
=========================

Problem
-------
Video export process getting stuck at "Processing video..." despite progress reaching ~94%.

Root Cause
----------
1. Floating point precision issue in end condition:
   // Old code - problematic end check
   const isNearEnd = video.currentTime + 0.1 >= segment.trimEnd;
   
   Issues:
   - Adding 0.1 to check "near end" is imprecise
   - video.currentTime might never exactly reach segment.trimEnd
   - Last reported progress was 94.5% before getting stuck

2. Progress calculation:
   // Old code - could never reach exactly 100%
   onProgress?.(isNearEnd ? 100 : Math.min(progress, 100));

Fix
---
1. Use absolute difference for end check:
   const isAtEnd = Math.abs(video.currentTime - segment.trimEnd) < 0.1;

2. Cap progress at 99.9% until complete:
   onProgress?.(isAtEnd ? 100 : Math.min(currentProgress, 99.9));

3. Added logging to track export state:
   console.log('[VideoExporter] Progress:', {
     currentTime: video.currentTime,
     trimEnd: segment.trimEnd,
     progress: currentProgress,
     isAtEnd
   });

Verification
-----------
- Export completes successfully
- Progress reaches 100%
- MediaRecorder stops properly
- Download triggers as expected
